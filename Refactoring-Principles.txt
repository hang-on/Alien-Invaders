1. Try to break the code down into agents and active structures: Handlers,
   controllers, loaders, timers, etc.
2. Let these structures have init_ functions to initialize vars etc.
3. Pass arguments to these functions. Try not to have built-in data. It seems
   to be something about keeping names/data on the same level.
4. Have well.defined functions. Give clear names to these functions.
